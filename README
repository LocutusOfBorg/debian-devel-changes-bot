debian-devel-changes IRC bot
============================

Requirements:

 * Python >= 2.4
 * Beautiful Soup (python-beautifulsoup)
 * Supybot
 * Local MTA
 * lockfile-progs

Installation
------------

  * Obtain a copy of the bot sources and place in an empty directory. We will
    refer to this dir as $SOURCE_DIR.

  * Ensure that
     - $SOURCE_DIR/bin/ is writable by the supybot user (so that it can create a FIFO)
     - $SOURCE_DIR/bin/lockfile/ is writable by your MTA

  * Create an email address which outputs mail directed to it to the STDIN of
    $SOURCE_DIR/bin/debian-devel-changes-bot.sh. Under Exim you can use the
    "pipe" transport for this.

    You should keep this email address secret so that 3rd-parties cannot inject
    specially crafted messages onto the channel.

  * Configure a Supybot instance using the "supybot-wizard" command. You are
    recommended to run this in the "bot-config" directory under $SOURCE_DIR (it
    will be ignored by the revision control system).

  * Add "$SOURCE_DIR/plugin" to the "supybot.directories.plugins" directive in
    your ".conf" file.

  * Run supybot $SOURCE_DIR/bot-config/<conffile>.conf to start the bot.

  * Call "!channel supybot.plugins.DebianDevelChanges.show_changes" in every
    channel you wish the bot to emit change notices.

  * Subscribe the bot to the following lists:

     - http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/
     - http://lists.debian.org/debian-bugs-dist/
