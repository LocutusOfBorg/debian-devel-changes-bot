Package: partman-base

As I understand it, RAID devices are being transitioned from /dev/mdX=20
to /dev/md/X. Currently parted_devices (or probably rather libparted),=20
still returns the former, even if a RAID device was created as the latter.

This is if both block device files exist. If the former does not exist,=20
parted_devices fails to list the device.

As partman prefers the latter notation over the former, the fact that=20
parted_devices does not support the latter causes problems, for example in=
=20
partman-base's init.d/parted script.

This BR is filed mostly as a reminder. See also #475479.
