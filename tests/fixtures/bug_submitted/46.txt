Package: grub-common
Version: 1.96+20080413-1
Severity: normal

I am using loop-aes (via loop-aes-modules-2.6.24-1-686 and
loop-aes-utils) for an encrypted root filesystem.

However, I can not update to a new kernel (automatically) because grub
cannot figure out which drive my encrypted partition is on.
