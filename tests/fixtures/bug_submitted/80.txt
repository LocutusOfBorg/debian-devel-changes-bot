Package: kxneur
Version: 0.8.0+svn20080310-1
Severity: serious
User: debian-qa@lists.debian.org
Usertags: qa-ftbfs-20080419 qa-ftbfs
Justification: FTBFS on i386

Hi,

During a rebuild of all packages in sid, your package failed to build on i386.

This rebuild was done with gcc 4.3 instead of gcc 4.2, because gcc 4.3 is now
the default on most architectures (even if it's not the case on i386 yet).
Feel free to downgrade this bug to 'important' if your package is only built
on i386, and this bug is specific to gcc 4.3 (i.e the package builds fine with
gcc 4.2).

Relevant part:

About the archive rebuild: The rebuild was done on about 50 AMD64 nodes
of the Grid'5000 platform, using a clean chroot containing a sid i386
environment.  Internet was not accessible from the build systems.
