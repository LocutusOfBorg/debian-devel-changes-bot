Package: gnucash-common
Version: 2.0.5-1
Severity: minor

The file /usr/share/info/gnucash-design.info.gz is installed by the
package, but it is not listed in /usr/share/info/dir so I cannot access
it from within emacs C-h i

I suggest to check whether the package failed to run
  /usr/sbin/install-info gnucash-design
in its post-installation scripts.
