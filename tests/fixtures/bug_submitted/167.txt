Package: wnpp
Severity: normal

The previous maintainer of bitcollider has set the maintainer to Debian QA
without opening a wnpp bug.  Therefore, I orphan this package now.

Maintaining a package requires time and skills. Please only adopt this
package if you will have enough time and attention to work on it.

If you want to be the new maintainer, please see
http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/index.html#howto-o for detailed
instructions how to adopt a package properly.

Description: collects bitprint and other information from files for bitzi.com
 Think of it as a really big file hash database on the internet with
 constant contributions from others of metadata on files.
 .
 Bitcollider is a small program to reliably identify and describe files
 on your machine. When run with a specific file as input, this program
 does two major things:
 .
 * It examines the file, calculating a distinctive digital fingerprint,
   or bitprint, and taking note of some other identifying information that
   can be extracted from the file, like file length and the local filename.
 * It launches your web browser to do a lookup at our website, submitting
   this identifying information as the search terms.
 .
 At bitzi.com you'll see what - if anything - others have said about your
 file, and have a chance to contribute descriptions or comments yourself.
 If your automatic submission included information useful to our database,
 that new information will be contributed to the database under your screen
 name.
