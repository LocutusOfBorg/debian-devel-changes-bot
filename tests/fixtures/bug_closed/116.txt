Package: bash
Version: 3.1dfsg-8
Severity: normal

I'm running Stable/Testing[1] for month, and I've seen this behaviour
only for the awfull Nvidia proprietary driver package : a testing
update+upgrade could lead to have bash removed because of a missing
dependency.

Here is the Aptitude screen showing this:

  -> Keep nvidia-glx at version 100.14.19-1 (now)
  -> Downgrade nvidia-glx [100.14.19-1 (now) -> 1.0.8776-4 (stable)]
  -> Remove nvidia-glx [100.14.19-1 (now)]

[1(1)/...] Suggest 3 keeps
e: Examine  !: Apply  .: Next  ,: Previous

-------------

One can see that there is an option to REMOVE bash.
Indeed when one'll choose this option, aptitude will not select it
for removal... Hopefully ;)

But how could this be that an essential package like bash has a missing
dependency in testing ? Should we improve/harden the frontier between
unstable and testing ?

I'd be interested in knowing more about this. You can count on my help if
some is needed.

Cheers,
M.
