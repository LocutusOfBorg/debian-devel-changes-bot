Package: iso-scan
Version: 1.24
Severity: important

More version info: lenny hd-media 20080227 booted via BootX

Hello,

I'm working on a Lenny install on my Wallstreet Powerbook G3 powerpc 
system and ran into an unexpected result with iso-scan mounting up the iso 
as it should, but this caused the partitioner to break.

I have what I believe is a pretty standard Mac partition setup on this 
system, using the Macintosh layout, which has a bunch of partitions at the 
beginning, usually putting the first real partition of any size, an HFS 
partition containing Mac OS 9.2 at hda9, at less than 1mb into the disk, 
and I'm starting my debian system at hda10 for root and hda11 for swap.

The problem comes in when iso-scan runs through the list of devices to 
look for the ISO image to complete the install, and actually selects the 
whole disk hda first, and mounts it.  At this point, all of the mkfs 
programs I tried flat out refused to format /dev/hda10.  mkreiserfs was 
willing to do the necessary work, but the device could not be mounted as 
the system already thought the whole device was in use, which perhaps it 
might have been, as /dev/hda (the whole thing) was mounted on /hd-media.

Line 116 of iso-scan.postinst reads:

DEVS="$(list-devices disk; list-devices partition; list-devices maybe-usb-floppy)"

I believe this might work better for my situation if the scan order were 
partition, disk, floppy.  I'm assuming that in that case, it would scan 
individual partitions first, find the iso in /dev/hda9, and everything 
from that point would continue as expected.  That is to say nothing about 
anyone else's situation with this program, but of course I must leave that 
to your discretion.

I was able to work around the problem by unmounting /hd-media, skipping 
back to the menu and formatting, then going back to the menu once more to 
continue from the scanning part.  So it's not impossible, it just might 
seem that way.

Thanks for a great installer, and please let me know if I can help with 
additional testing or information.  I hope I am not overstating the 
severity of the bug, but the usability of the package is in my opinion 
degraded severely for the hd-media install case.

-Sam
