About the archive rebuild: The rebuild was done on about 50 AMD64 nodes
of the Grid'5000 platform, using a clean chroot containing a sid i386
environment.  Internet was not accessible from the build systems. All
packages have been rebuilt twice in a row, with unpack, build, clean,
build.

Please read the mail of Martin Zobel-Helas on debian-devel [0], for a explanation 
for this mass bug filling.
