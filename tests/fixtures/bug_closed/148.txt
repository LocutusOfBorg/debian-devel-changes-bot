Package: konqueror
Version: 4:3.5.1-1
Severity: normal

Bug is reproduced in the following way:
1) Open some location, for example /usr/share/qt3/doc/html/ (i used 
icons view - may be it is important);
2) Select Service -> Find menu item (not sure about the english names - 
I'm using localized konqueror);
3) Type anything in Content search (Contains text) and click "Search";
4) Open some results in new tab;
5) Close the search tab (with search dialog) - leads to crash.

The following debug information is provided by kcrash:
