Package: openbsd-inetd
Version: 0.20050402-5
Severity: normal

There's some cruft in my system's /etc:

547 {0} root@sisyphus:/etc# find -name "S20inetd" | xargs file
./rc2.d/S20inetd: broken symbolic link to `../init.d/inetd'
./rc3.d/S20inetd: broken symbolic link to `../init.d/inetd'
./rc4.d/S20inetd: broken symbolic link to `../init.d/inetd'
./rc5.d/S20inetd: broken symbolic link to `../init.d/inetd'

I spoke with Steve Langasek about this on IRC.  Replacing a package that
has conffiles is usually painful (I learned this from X, particularly with
the XKB data).

Here's what openbsd-inetd should probably do:
1) Ensure all those symlinks are removed.
2) Since /etc/init.d/inetd is a "dying" conffile, and not being "moved" to
   openbsd-inetd, the really polite thing to do would be to grab MD5 sums of
   the stock versions of that file from, say, the last stable and unstable
   releases of netkit-inetd, and check any lingering inetd conffile to see
   if it matches either of those sums.  If it does, remove it.  If it
   doesn't, leave it, as the administrator likely customized it (and might
   want to "port" his or her customizations over to openbsd-inetd's init
   script)..

You could do the above in preinst or postinst, whichever is convenient.
The postinst is probably less trouble, because that way you wouldn't have
to roll back what you did on a failed installation[1].

[1] Most maintainer scripts I've seen don't actually bother to carefully
    roll back what was done in the "install" and "upgrade" targets of the
    preinst in the "abort-install" and "abort-upgrade" targets of the
    postrm.  But that's what dpkg supports and the Policy Manual expects.

 openbsd-inetd (0.20080125-1) unstable; urgency=3Dlow
 .
   * New CVS snapshot.
   * Package painfully converted to quilt.
   * Fixed a typo in debian/control. (Closes: #125181)
   * Fixed a typo in the init script. (Closes: #465613, #465732)
   * Delete /etc/rc[2345].d/S20inetd too when upgrading from netkit-inetd=
.
     (Closes: #416010)
   * Do not use log_warning_msg in the init script when inetd.conf is emt=
py,
     this is not something deserving extra attention. (Closes: #435658)
   * Document in inetd(8) that datagram services must read some network
     input or inetd will continue spawning them.
     Many thanks to James Cameron for the analysis. (Closes: #436803)
   * Use a real characters class instead of character ranges with grep
     in the init script, because some locales have weird ranges.
     Spotted by Meelis Roos. (Closes: #458564)
