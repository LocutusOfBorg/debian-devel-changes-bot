Package: tex-common
Version: 1.10
Severity: important


There have been numerous default-paper-size bugs reported.  The
argument against fixing them seems to be along the lines of "The user
can figure it out."  Well, yes, the user _can_, but the user can also
write a complete OS from scratch.  Downloading something is _supposed_
to be easier than writing it from scratch BECAUSE downloaded programs
are supposed to do some of the standard work for you.

There is a comment in /usr/share/doc/tex-common/README.Debian that
says

     The Debian TeX Live packages currently do not evaluate the
     settings of `/etc/papersize', please set the paper geometry
     explicitly in the (La)TeX source, e.g.  using the packages
     `geometry' or `hyperref'.

That is very poor behaviour.  Here's why:

* TeX is designed to let you concentrate on what you're writing rather
  than on layout.  For this reason TeX has a very nice page-breaking
  algorithm that handles layout for you so you don't have to worry
  about where page breaks are, or what size paper you're using.  The
  Debian policy is counter to this philosophy.

* If I write all my documents and have to specify in each one what
  size paper to use, and then I want to send them to a collaborator
  who will be printing drafts on _her_ printer, and she lives
  somewhere with a different paper size, then each of us will have to
  modify the document back and forth, back and forth, at each
  printing.  Again, if I move to somewhere with a different paper
  size, I should be able to set that systemwide and have everything
  adjust, rather than modify every document I've ever written or had
  sent to me.

* "There is no default; specify paper size per document" is stupid.
  What about specifying a font size, weight, italics or not, duplex or
  not, etc?  Why have defaults at all?  Why is it appropriate to have
  a default font size but not to have a default paper size?

Here's the thing: the paper size I want to use will depend on the
printer to which my computer is connected, not on which document I am
printing.  Therefore the setting should be per printer (or tray),
which is a bit complicated.  However, since writing is compiled per
computer, a reasonable approximation is this: printers in the USA and
Canada use "letter", while printers in the civilised world use "a4".
So the default paper size can usually be safely set per printer
location, which is roughly per computer.

If you travel, you should be able to change ONE THING and have access
to all the local printers.

Hi,

although the discussion in the bug log wasn't the most friendly one,
it's clear that there's no new information in it at all. We already do
have bug reports against the relevant packages, without patches but with
a design decision how it should be solved. Therefore I close this bug.

Regards, Frank
