Package: setmixer
Version: 27DEC94ds1-1
Severity: Wishlist

I have yet to find any sound mixer application that can properly control
all my sound devices.  With setmixer conflicting with alsa-base and
aumix, I loose functionality.  Removing the functionality that saves and
restores mixer settings on boot-up and the resulting conflicts would be
a better solution than conflicting with similar programs and thereby
leaving Debian users with one less option.  Just because a program _can_
be run at system startup doesn't mean it _has_ to be.

I can have multiple types of web browsers and editors and all manner of
programs, why can't I have multiple types of mixers?

The result of the recent changes is that one more useful piece of
software - one more option - cannot be installed.  On the other hand, if
the initscripts and conflicts were removed, functionality would be
retained and I would still have all my options.  If someone wants to run
setmixer at boot, it's relatively easy to put a little script in
/etc/rc.boot. It's also reasonable to assume that someone wanting to use
an obscure commandline program like setmixer would be capable of doing
so.  An example startup script could even be placed in
/usr/share/doc/setmixer/examples.

Referencing bug # 202151, if the maintainer believes, "...looks like
aumix has improved since I uploaded setmixer, so  there is not much
specific need for setmixer anymore", he should probably give up the
program.

Setmixer has now been removed from debian. Setting mixer by
default on boottime is not done by alsa-base. Setting mixer
from command line is done with "amixer" command
from alsa-utils.

"rm -rf" only sounds scary if you don't have backups
