	[score: 0.0000]

I've tried the 2.6.25-trunk kernel, and the latest in sid and as of 
today (2008-04-20) the only way I can transfer videos from my dv camera 
to my hard disk is with Holger's kernels (the ones with the old firewire 
stack enabled). I do not understand why the debian kernel maintainers 
are so unwilling to allow people to choose which firewire stack they 
use. This is clearly a case of theory not matching reality--it is 
irrelevant whether the new stack is conceptually cleaner if it doesn't 
work with the software people are trying to use. In my experience, the 
new stack is much better for firewire attached disks, but unusable for 
video work. Are the people pushing for having only the new stack in the 
debian kernels doing video work? 

(I'm also having no success whatsoever in using the new stack for 
devices attached to firewire hubs or daisy chained from one device to 
another; only direct connect seems to be working--anyone else having the 
same problem?)
