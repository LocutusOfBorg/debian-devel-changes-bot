  I'm really not sure what could be going on here.  That's the same
build of aptitude that you should be running.  I would suspect a
self-built copy hanging out somewhere, except that your error message
clearly says "aptitude 0.4.10".  From the code, I can't imagine how this
could fail if, e.g., "upgrade" works.

  Just for kicks, could you try running "aptitude --version" and
"/usr/bin/aptitude safe-upgrade"?  If those don't produce any obvious
explanation, I'll leave this as unreproducible until I get the piece of
information I'm overlooking that will make it all clear.

  Daniel
