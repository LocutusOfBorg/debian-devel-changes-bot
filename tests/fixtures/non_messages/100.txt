Previously to you mentioning it just then, it was set to
suspend_to_disk.  I changed it to suspend_to_ram and restarted
powersaved however the same issue remains

>> What does powersaved say in debug mode?
It says for FN+F4:

>> What's the hald output for FN+F12? What does powersaved -v31 -f=20

lshal -m captures the following for FN+F12:

15:29:48.212: computer_logicaldev_input_3 condition ButtonPressed =3D
hibernate
15:29:48.215: computer condition ButtonPressed =3D hibernate

This compares to the 3 lines captured for FN+F4:
15:30:50.355: computer_logicaldev_input_3 condition ButtonPressed =3D sle=
ep
15:30:50.355: computer condition ButtonPressed =3D sleep
15:30:50.384: platform_i8042_i8042_KBD_port_logicaldev_input condition
ButtonPressed =3D sleep

Powersaved in debug mode says the following for FN+F12:

Apr 20 15:31:35 localhost powersaved[10707]: DIAG

I am running kpowersave because I need to have something in KDE and Xfce
to see what battery power I've got left, to see messages sent from hal
to powersaved about battery low and critical warnings, as well as having
something that allows me to suspend and hibernate with a couple of clicks=
=2E

I don't think this is an issue as I've just terminated kpowersave and
have restarted powersaved (out of debug mode) and the FN+F4 and FN+F12
combinations still don't result in S3 or S4.
