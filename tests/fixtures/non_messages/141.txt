First of, I'm not personally using this software I just happened to be
on the same IRC channel as the original submitter and had nothing better
to do at the time so I started looking at it.

Personally I agree with the original submitter that having a default
which consists of writing $inputfilename.html overwriting anything
happening to be there already in the process seems wrong on some level.=20
So I went with the assumption that the built in help function described
the intended way, and the code somehow went wrong along the way.=20

I have since determined the upstream 2.9 has the same behaviour as the
debian package, as well as the same broken --help description. Actually
the whole -o/--output scheme seems to be broken upstream, I never
managed to make it do anything but STDOUT and $filename.html, no matter
what I specified.

Perhaps the best thing is to simply report this issue to upstream and
check what their oppinion is on what should be the correct behaviour and
then take it from there?

Then we can at some point send them a patch which at least makes the
behaviour and the --help text consistent.

Please let me know your thoughts about the above.
