I cannot get any wlan information, like iwlist scanning, afterwards, so it might be a problem with the iwl3945 driver, since I have used ipw3945 before. On my iBook I have to reconfigure the b43 wlan driver with ifup/ifdown after suspending, too.

S2Ram hangs after switching on (hd-led switched on) on since 2.6.24
here. Even alt+print+reisub does not show any effect. This might be
another bug report.
Can you connect to your NFS4 mounts without using the portmapper? I have
had to open it in the firewall to reenable my clients again, which
should not be necessary.

Several people can be logged in a graphical session at the same time,
even on a laptop.

I have removed the module and have tried 2.6.25-trunk. Then I have tried
2.6.24-1 again. It always worked. It even worked with going back to my
old setup, so I guess that the error is not reproducable with a freshly
booted system and this information is useless. I will try to recheck it
during the next days with longer sessions.
