Dear maintainer of ntop and Debian translators,

On Friday, April 18, 2008 I sent a notice to the maintainer of the ntop Deb=
ian
package, mentioning the status of at least one old po-debconf translation u=
pdate in the BTS (bug #414836).

I announced the intent to build and possibly upload a non-maintainer upload
for this package in order to fix this long-time pending localization
bug as well as all other pending translations.

The package maintainer agreed for the NMU or did not respond in two
weeks, so I will proceed with the NMU.

The full planned schedule is available at the end of this mail.

The package is currently translated to: de es fr it ja nl pt sv

Among these, the following translations are incomplete: <none>

If you did any of the, currently incomplete, translations you will get
ANOTHER mail with the translation to update.

Other translators also have the opportunity to create new translations
for this package. Once completed, please send them as a bug report
against the ntop package so I can incorporate them in the build.

The deadline for receiving updates and new translations is Wednesday, April=
 30, 2008. If you
are not in time you can always send your translation to the BTS.

The POT file is attached to this mail.

If the maintainer objects to this process I will immediately abort my NMU
and send him/her all updates I receive.

Otherwise the following will happen (or already has):

 Friday, April 18, 2008   : send the first intent to NMU notice to
                 the package maintainer.
 Sunday, April 20, 2008       : send this notice
 Wednesday, April 30, 2008       : deadline for receiving translation updat=
es
 Thursday, May 01, 2008       : build the package and upload it to DELAYED/=
0-day
                 send the NMU patch to the BTS
 Friday, May 02, 2008       : NMU uploaded to incoming

Thanks for your efforts and time.
