  apt-listbugs is invoked because it's listed in Dpkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs.
This is the hook for commands that are invoked just before dpkg is
called to install the new packages.  aptitude doesn't even invoke this
directly; it happens behind the scenes when the apt library is told to
run dpkg.

  In order to get the effect you want, you would need a new hook that
ran before any download started, and aptitude would have to explicitly
ask to invoke it (as would all the other apt frontends).
