I don't have a new tab button, except in the menu; I use control-T to
get a new tab....

Watching myself more carefully, I noticed that I sometimes also paste
bug numbers this way then add bugs.debian.org/ in front: I'm not only
pasting valid URLs.

(With a non-blank URL bar, if I use control-L or otherwise select the
existing URL to overtype it with this, Epiphany loses my previous
selection for middle-pasting.  I can paste the number on the end of the
URL then clear out what I don't want, but that's rather fiddly.  Of
course ideally all bug numbers would always work as links and I wouldn't
need to paste stuff around like this -- or I should learn to use
control-C/control-V instead of middle clicking.)

So why does opening a new window give the old behaviour, i.e. an empty
URL bar?
