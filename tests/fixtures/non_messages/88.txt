Please don=E2=80=99t do that. It will be re-added later.

There are already several packages relying on the "namespace packages"
feature. The problem is when you have two modules, named foo.bar and
foo.baz, shipped in two different packages. If each of them shipped
foo/__init__.py, they couldn=E2=80=99t be installed together, and this is w=
hy
the empty __init__.py needs to be generated automaticaly.

We=E2=80=99ve already discussed the issue on IRC before sam reported the bu=
g,
and I still think the bug lies in python-twisted. Shipping modules in
the site-packages directory without making them available to the user
through 'import' is a clear abuse of the python API.=20

Of course it is possible to work around that bug in python-support by
adding a specific exception for python-twisted, but this is a
last-resort measure, and I don=E2=80=99t want to do this when it is so easy=
 to
fix twisted, by removing the __init__.py check that was recently added
by upstream.

Cheers,
