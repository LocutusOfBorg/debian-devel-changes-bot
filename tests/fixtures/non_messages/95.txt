Hmmm...I didn't realize that it was in /target.  I'm not sure exactly
then, but in the syslog the cdrom is not found (scanned) and without
the trickery I mentioned the base install fails, which according to the
syslog is because apt can't find the packages (which makes sense since
it has no sources of packages at that point).

I can't be more specific because I the systems I installed are now in
use.

Beside the syslog the other clue the cdrom isn't being scanned is that
the prompt for a successful scan and do you want another never comes up.

Regards,

Daniel
