No, not particularly at this point; I think there are plenty of bug 
reports indicating that the userspace components in debian don't support 
juju well. (Or, if you're talking about the issues with firewire chains, 
I was hoping for a "yes that works here" or "it doesn't work for 
anybody" before I spend an hour or two gathering information. Especially 
since leaving a firewire device plugged into the hub causes the whole 
system to freeze after a minute or two.)

>that would be a start to do something useful.

A start to doing something useful would be to admit that there is no 
possibility that the new firewire stack can be reasonably tested for 
video applications by the time lenny freezes.
