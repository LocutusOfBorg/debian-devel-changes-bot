Hi,

please stop this discussion about buggy ubuntu here, the bug is long enough=
=20
already and we should rather concentrate on fixing it and all its blockers,=
=20
instead of trying to fix this issue.

As I read it, the user either (re!)installed Debian over Ubuntu and now he=
=20
complains he got Debian... ;)

Or:

"<hermanr> The suggested fix from the guy at #ubuntu-devel was to rip out t=
he=20
config bits from the debian-edu packages, as they were based on assumptions=
=20
about stock Debian." - which would mean, the user installed Ubuntus=20
debian-edu packages and they are so broken, that they turn a Ubuntu system=
=20
into something strange+broken... But this would also mean, this is offtopic=
=20
here.=20

And if the second possibility is true, or even if not, I wonder why there a=
re=20
debian-edu* packages in Ubuntu anyway. AFAIK Edubuntu doesnt use them...=20
(which also explains why they are broken.)


regards,
	Holger
