Hm, okay.  I guess I was always used to thinking about it one way.

The problem being solved is, given a random Debian *.deb package, how do I
obtain its copyright?  Currently, I may have to locate all *.deb packages
on which it depends with an explicit version number, but that's all.
Weakening this to allow indirect dependencies requires either recursively
resolving all dependencies with explicit versions or trying to track the
binary to a source package, locate the source package, and then retrieve
its other binary packages.  Both of those seem like they require more
sophisticated code.

But more to the point, I don't really understand why adding an explicit
dependency is a problem, particularly if all the packages are built from
the same source package.
