The Alpha BIOS itself doesn't enable or disable anything, so I'm not
sure what I could do there. I'm not really sure what [disabled] means
in the lspci output anyway. It also reports that the SCSI controller
BIOS is disabled, but that is working fine.

I have kept Etch up to date, but only with the "stable" configuration.
The Xorg server shows a compile date in January of 2008, which really
doesn't seem that old, but I suppose I might be able to install
something from the testing or unstable packages. I tried switching to
a different video card, ELSA Gloria L, that has an S3ViRGE chip, but
that gives similar results, even though it seems to want the s3virge
driver or possibly the glint (it has two 3DLabs coprocessors on it.)
The ELSA card works with Windows NT on this box, but not with OpenVMS
so I swapped back to the S3 Trio.
