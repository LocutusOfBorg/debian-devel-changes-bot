Can't really comment on this. If you have any suggestions how to fix this 
without some long general timeout, we'd appreciate it.

Known issue. Should be fixed with new images. There have been build issues 
the past few days, but those should be solved tomorrow.

I don't see how apt-cdrom can be missing. It is included with the basic apt 
package. Can you please describe the actual symptoms and specific errors?
Note that apt-cdrom is always run in the /target chroot and not in the D-I 
environment itself.

Cheers,
