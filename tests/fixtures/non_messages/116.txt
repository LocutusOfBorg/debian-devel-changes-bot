Actually the problem is now gone. Unfortunately I was not careful to record
the order of steps taken, but here goes:

I looked at the logs and noticed exim4 (MTA) has not starting up properly,
so did dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config, which fixed that. I disabled acpid
(But I think I this this before with no difference). I also purged and
reinstalled portmap as that was unresponsesive to stop and restart commands.
At the end I installed kde-core in the hope that KDE would fare better.
After this I tried to log out of Gnome to start a KDE session, only to
dicover the logout now works.

It been a weird experience, but at the time I experience the issue the
system was 'clean'. I did a standard install from etch CD1 only (base +
desktop environment tasks). upgraded to testing and then sid. during the
upgrade apt had to remove gnome-desktop-environment to fulfill dependencies
(also I had to force glibc in manually with dpkg). after the system was
completely on sid I installed gnome-desktop-environment back and had could
not logout after restarting into a gnome session. No configuration changes
of  happened during the process.

Anyway thanks for your help.
