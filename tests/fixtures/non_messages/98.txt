Thanks for the report.

However, I will probably add a release note that until INLINE::Java is
available in Debian, we can't support autodia_java. This is because at
the point when it eventually is available, we don't need to fix autodia
again.

People who have INLINE::Java installed manually can already use
autodia_java.
