Yes, I've seen that too in Virtualbox. It takes a huge amount of time and 
you can actually see the display being "assembled".
/me needs to file a BR about that.

If that is true, it would IMO be a pretty serious bug in win32-loader as 
Debian is supposed to be installed using UTF-8 locales by default.

Robert: can you please look into this?

Not really needed; will be loaded automatically if needed.

As long as it exists, I see no harm to continue to select it. When it is 
removed from the archive, D-I will automatically fall back correctly.

That's #473401.

See http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2008/04/msg00570.html.

Yes, the transitional packages have a priority of standard or higher, so 
they get installed. Please take this up with the respective maintainers.


Reassigning to win32-loader as that is the only real issue remaining.
Thanks for the elaborate report, though some clearer indication of what you 
consider to be issues would be welcome next time.

Cheers,
FJP
